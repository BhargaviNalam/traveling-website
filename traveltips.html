        <h3>Travel Document</h3>
        <h3>PassPort</h3>
        <p>Many countries may not even let you enter if you have less than 6 months validity on your passport and your request for a visa may be denied if you don’t have enough free pages in your passport.</p>
        <h3>Visa</h3>
        <p>You’ll need to check in advance whether you need a visa which is a document issued by the destination country granting you entry. Showing up to your flight without the necessary visa may lead to you being rejected, especially if you cannot apply for one on arrival.</p>

        <h3>Research destination</h3>
        <p>It is important to invest plenty of time in researching your destination to optimize your experience. While it may seem more fun to travel spontaneously, it is far more practical if you are able to anticipate some of the nuances of your destination country by studying the tips for traveling abroad for the first time.</p>

        <h3>Money Sustainbility</h3>
       <p>Depending on your destination, you may not have easy access to ATMs. Some countries that run on largely cash economies might not even have card readers at most restaurants or businesses. If this is the case, be sure to carry enough money on you to cover your expenses on a day out. Some travelers store larger sums of money in a money belt for safety.</p>

        <h3>Comparing Transport and Acommidations</h3>
        <h4>Transport</h4>
        <p>Websites such as "Rio2Rome and 12Go "are great tools for exploring route options and figuring out which mode of transportation (bus, train, or plane) will be the quickest and cheapest.</p>
       <h4>Acommidations</h4>
       <p>While hotels are always a good option, hostels, guesthouses, and Airbnb can work out to be cheaper and more immersive, allowing you to meet other travelers. If you opt for a hostel, boutique hostels are oftentimes equipped with nicer amenities than budget hotels.</p>

    <h3> Booking everthing in advance</h3>
    <p>If you are certain of your itinerary, the best time to book your trip is whenever you have the money and the commitment to travel. While it is nice to have the freedom to make the last-minute choice of where to stay, don’t be surprised if accommodation is scarce or suddenly very pricey when you show up at your destination.</p>
